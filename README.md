Meteorological Trend Analysis for Mymensingh Region
This repository contains a comprehensive study on the trend analysis of meteorological parameters over the Mymensingh region in Bangladesh, based on data from 1998 to 2022. The analysis focuses on temperature, relative humidity, dew-point temperature, and rainfall, utilizing statistical and numerical techniques.
Project Overview
The project, submitted as part of the Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics (AMTH-460: Honours Project) at the University of Dhaka, explores climate trends using methods such as the Mann-Kendall test, Sen's Slope estimator, and linear regression. The study aims to identify monotonic trends and amplitude changes in the mentioned parameters.

Figures: Included within the PDF, these illustrate yearly mean forecasts for temperature, relative humidity, dew-point temperature, and rainfall.

Methodology

Data Source: Daily data from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) spanning 1998-2022.
Techniques: 
Mann-Kendall Trend Test for detecting monotonic trends.
Sen's Slope estimator for magnitude of change.
Linear Regression for predictive modeling.


Analysis: Conducted on yearly and seasonal data to assess trends and variability.

Key Findings
